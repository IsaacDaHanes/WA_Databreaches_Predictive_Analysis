Title - Members of the board, stockholders, partners and piers.
	Isaac Hanes.
	Cybersecurity in Washington State
	Have received questions: how to save money? how to save time? How to cut losses?
	most important; where to bolster defenses?
	Saves money AND time by saving people, less to clean up
	This presentation is the budding answer to that question

Data - Highlights: Year column(fiscal year of when report was made)
		   YearText(rendundant)
		   BreachLifecycleRange(categorical ranges)
		   A lot of fluff
		   More in README

Predictive/Inferential - Not succesful Predictors for number affected due to variation
			 Other data is needed: security level and size of organization
			 Over time this data could be added
			 Time will be a very important theme moving forwards

Seasons - Through thoughtful analysis can provide meaningful info in other ways

Years - correlation and trend

Rate - Spike shows specific growth in attack tech
       Back and forth shows relationship between attack and defense: repartee, a sort of banter.

Model - when reports are made, number affected usually isn't available for a while
	end of year summary predictions
	could in the future be used to predict numbers in the following years
	average line
	95% of data ends up in blue swath

Gov vs. nonprof 1 - thousands of resamples, majority of the time in the middle. Same in the following slide

Gov vs. nonprof 2 - When time is introduced see how they switch places
		    Numbers are per day
		    Given time, the truth reveals itself

Conclusion - Ransomware is the biggest threat(not in presentation, but is in notebooks and previous explorations)
	     Given time other relationships could be tested
	     Save time by investing time
	     Save money by investing money
	     Invest in this database
	     Invest in this analysis
